Today, many applications need instant search experiences to help users navigate through their app and allow them to find the information they are looking for quickly and seamlessly. For example, when you type into Google and many other sites, you get search suggestions automatically as you type. Through React Instant Search, the tool we’ll build in this tutorial, you can easily add a search experience into your application!
React Instant Search combines both React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and Algolia, a powerful API that allows you to easily implement a search engine within your applications, to provide an instant search experience to users.
In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a basic React app and use Algolia to add search to your app.
