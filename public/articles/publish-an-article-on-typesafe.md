> The goal of [Typesafe](https://typesafe.blog) is to give **YOU** an opportunity to _inspire_ thousands of developers **with your articles**.

I created https://typesafe.blog to give talented web developers - _who doesn't necessarily work for big startups or companies with a wide reach_ - a chance to become known through their articles while helping and inspiring other people.

# Why should I post articles on Typesafe?

First of all, writing blog articles will always be beneficial for you (and your career). You can find an article [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/every-developer-should-have-a-blog-heres-why-and-how-to-stick-with-it-5fd55a247fbf/#:~:text=A%20blog%20is%20useful%20for,audience%20and%20express%20your%20ideas.) that goes into the _why_.

[Typesafe](https://typesafe.blog) is a great place for posting an article. It is brand new and built to scale well and rank well in search engines. I attached great importance to the minimalism and design of the website to focus on the/your posts themselves.

There is currently no advertising on Typesafe, so it is a non-profit site. The complete focus is on the content.

Furthermore, every post is reviewed & evaluated before publication, so the reader can be sure that _your_ article must also be very good.

The main reasons summarised:

-   Sell yourself - show the world what you are capable of
-   Inspire people
-   Reach a great audience
